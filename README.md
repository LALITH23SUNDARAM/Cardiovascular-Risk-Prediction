## Cardiovascular Risk Prediction

**Abstract:** We often came across the phrase from medic "In case it detected earlier, we could have saved the lives". The period is a crucial factor in healthcare, even a week plays a mighty role. Infections like Cancer, heart disease, STD is more likely curable at the primary stage. The Objective of every healthcare organization is to "Early diagnosis and Timely treatment". Human body generates a huge amount of data each day starting from blood pressure, heart rate, glucose level, pulse rate, Body temperature, platelet counts and so many. These points are classified with some limits. If some factor points go beyond or behind a certain level it's considered abnormalities. If we store and understand this information, both patients and doctors are able to understand the situation. Data science plays a vital role in monitoring these observations and predicts the risk and being able to act timely. Healthcare leverages the uses of data science and results. Reduce the costs of treatment, predict the outbreaks of pandemics, avoid preventable diseases, and improves the quality of Humans life. In this project we generated a classification model, it predicts whether the person would have heart risk from the given health conditions.

### Problem Statement:

Framingham Heart Study is an ongoing study on heart-related risks of residents of Framingham, Massachusetts. Here we are given with dataset having 3390 residents' natural behaviors, Past Medical history, and present observations.
### RoadMap:

* Understanding Mising values.
    * Missing Completly at Random (MCAR).
    * Missing Not at Random (MNAR).
* Handling Missing Values.
    * K-NN Imputation.

* Understands the Data Distribution.
 
* Relation between Dependent and Independent variables. Checked Multicollinearity.

* Labelling Categorical Values.

* Handling Class Imbalance
    * Sinthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE).
    * SMOTE + Tomek Link

* Train-Test Split

* Normalization

* Model Training

   * Logistics Regression
   * Support Vector Machine
        * Linear Kernel
        * Polynomial Kernel
